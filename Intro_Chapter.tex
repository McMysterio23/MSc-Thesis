The current state-of-the-art quantum communications technologies base its functioning principles upon entangled states of single photons.
This is a completely new field, characterized by a very recent and still developing theoretical background. 
Although Quantum optics finds its roots in the 50s with the first discoveries brought by Glauber and Hanbury, Brown and Twiss, the key interest rose only in the decennia 70-90s.
Modern day quantum optics gained even more interest with the discovery of single photon light sources like quantum dots, as well as the introduction of ultra-fast single photon detectors : Technologies developed all after the advent of the new century. % that came into reality only at the beginning of the new century

In recent years the perspectives of a widely spread use of totally safe mean of communication based on quantum communication principles, is attracting like never the interest of public and private entities.
